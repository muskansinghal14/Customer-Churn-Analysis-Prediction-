# Customer-Churn-Analysis-Prediction-
This is my first Capstone Project 

**OVERVIEW**

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether the customer will leave the bank or not i.e. Exited or not. In this project, the focus is set on predicting whether a specific customer will continue to use the bankâ€™s services or not. This allows the bank to determine the factors that lead to customers leaving their services for other financial services, and an in-depth analysis can help the financial institutions retain the customers.

The dataset provided had 10,000 rows and 14 attributes such as Credit Score, Gender, Age, Tenure, Estimated Salary, and more. A classifier is being built to determine which customers will Exit and which will not. Here, I have to deal with a classification problem whose main focus is to predict Discrete Values.
