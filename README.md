# Customer-Churn-Analysis-Prediction-
This is my first Capstone Project 

## OVERVIEW

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether the customer will leave the bank or not i.e. Exited or not. In this project, the focus is set on predicting whether a specific customer will continue to use the bank’s services or not. This allows the bank to determine the factors that lead to customers leaving their services for other financial services, and an in-depth analysis can help the financial institutions retain the customers.

The dataset provided had 10,000 rows and 14 attributes such as Credit Score, Gender, Age, Tenure, Estimated Salary, and more. A classifier is being built to determine which customers will Exit and which will not. Here, I have to deal with a **classification problem** whose main focus is to predict Discrete Values.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

The project focuses on providing a data-driven solution to predict whether a customer will churn or not.

## DATA CLEANING

While working on the pre-defined datasets, I did data cleaning of my dataset. The dataset consisted of a few unnecessary columns such as Row Number, Customer ID, and Surname which added little value in classifying the customers. These were dropped, as these only added noise to the dataset. It was also checked whether the dataset had any missing values, which it did not have.
The next task was to categorize the numerical and categorical variables. The categorical variables were Geography and Gender, which were both One-Hot-encoded. This data was then passed to the classifier, with the ground truth being the “Exited” attribute and all the remaining columns being the inputs.
